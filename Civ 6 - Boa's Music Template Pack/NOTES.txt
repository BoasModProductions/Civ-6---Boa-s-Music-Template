The instruction video was made during the creation of the Hidden Cloud Village mod, before its initial release in January 15 2022. I recorded my session in setting the music up purely for this template.

Be sure that you have all the required materials before using this template! Mainly, the following:
- Wwise v2015.1.9
- Your .ini file
- Your music files (Must all be in .wav)

Special thanks to Kevin Liu (for showing me the method exists), and Dwughjsd (for cracking the code and making this method)! You two are the best friends in modding I have, and I never could have done it without you!

(All the work in this template is a copy-paste of the setup Dwughjsd's Yuni mod project, which unlike this template, also covers voiced dialogue & unit sounds. This template however, is set up in such a way that I have already covered the technical steps, and all that's needed is to simply insert the music and have the settings "lock them in" so it works.)
